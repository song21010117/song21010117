We are a group of Computational Geophysics at China University of Petroleum (East China). We are committed to seismic imaging theory and technology innovation and domestic seismic imaging software development and application research.We hope to solve the world problems faced by seismic imaging of deep earth and deep-sea hidden reservoirs, such as the existence of blind zones in deep earth imaging and the seriousness of multiple solutions in deep-sea multi-component imaging.
